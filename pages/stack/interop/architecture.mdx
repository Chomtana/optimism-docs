# Interoperability architecture 

Interoperability is provided by an [OP Supervisor](./op-supervisor).
This supervisor keeps a copy of the events for all the blockchains in the interoperability cluster, and can therefore validate that cross-chain messages (which are always initiated with an event on the source cluster).

```mermaid

graph TB
  supervisor[OP Supervisor]
  subgraph mainnet[OP Mainnet]
    node1[OP Node]<-->geth1[Execution Engine]
  end
  subgraph base[Base]
    node2[OP Node]<-->geth2[Execution Engine]
  end
  subgraph l1[Ethereum L1]
    node3[Consensus Layer]<-->geth3[Execution Layer]
  end
  supervisor<-->mainnet
  supervisor<-->base  
  supervisor<-->l1
```

## How messages get from one chain to the other

```mermaid

sequenceDiagram
    participant app as Application
    participant src as Soucre Chain
    participant op-sup as OP Supervisor
    participant dst as Destination Chain
    app->>src: Transaction
    src->>op-sup: Log Event
    note over src,op-sup: Log Event = Initializing Message
    app->>dst: Transaction
    dst->>dst: Call to CrossL2Inbox to execute or verify a message.
    dst->>op-sup: Did you receive this initiating message?
    op-sup->>dst: Yes
    note left of dst: Call is successful
    dst->>dst: CrossL2Inbox emits ExecutingMessage.
    note over dst: Executing Message
```

## Safety levels

- *Unsafe* - not yet written to L1, obtained through gossip channels, ultimately based on trust in a sequencer.
- *Cross unsafe* - verified that all executing messages have legitimate initiating messages, but otherwise still unsafe.
  Treated as unsafe for most purposes.
- *Safe* - the block and all the blocks on which it depends (those with initiating mesages to which it has executing messages) have been written to L1.
- *Finalized* - the block and all the blocks on which it depends have been on L1 for long enough to make a reorg impossible.

    classDef finalized fill:#CCC
    classDef safe fill:#8F8
    classDef unsafe fill:#F89
    subgraph I[Blocks with Initiating Messages]
    style I fill:none
      subgraph A[Chain A]
        A0[Block n]
        A1[Block n+100]
        A2[Block n+105]
        class A0 finalized
        class A1 safe
        class A2 unsafe
      end
      subgraph B[Chain B]
        B0[Block m]
        B1[Block m+3]
        class B0,B1 safe
      end
    end
    subgraph C[Chain C]
      C0[Block with executing messages]
      class C0 unsafe
    end
    A0 --> C0
    A1 --> C0
    A2 --> C0
    B0 --> C0
    B1 --> C0 
```

A block should only be written to L1 once the blocks on which it depends are all safe.
