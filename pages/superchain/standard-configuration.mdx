# The Standard configuration 

The standard configuration within the OP Stack ensures that chains deployed in the Superchain ecosystem adhere to a consistent set of technical and governance parameters.
This standardization is critical for Superchain interoperability, network security, and ease of upgrading your chain.

This guide provides an in-depth explanation of what defines a standard configuration, how the OP-Deployer aids standardization, and why adhering to these standards is essential.

## What is a Standard chain?

A standard chain in the OP Stack refers to a rollup that adheres to the following principles:

1.  **Technical conformance:**
    *   Compliance with the OP Stack Specifications, including gas fees, block structure, and other protocol-level parameters.
        These requirements are currently a draft, pending governance approval. For more details, please see
        this [governance thread](https://gov.optimism.io/t/season-6-draft-standard-rollup-charter/8135)
        and the actual requirements in the [OP Stack Configurability Specification](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/configurability.html).
    *   Utilization of officially supported features and modules of the OP Stack.

2.  **Governance alignment:**
    *   Adherence to governance principles outlined in the [Blockspace Charter](/superchain/blockspace-charter).
    *   Transparent and collaborative decision-making aligned with the Superchain ecosystem.

3.  **Interoperability:**
    *   Maintaining compatibility with other chains in the Superchain ecosystem for seamless cross-chain interactions.

Chains that deviate from these principles, such as introducing unsupported features like custom gas tokens, are considered non-standard configurations.

## Role of OP-Deployer in Standardization

The [OP-Deployer](/builders/chain-operators/tools/op-deployer) is a powerful tool designed to automate and streamline the deployment of standard configuration-compliant chains.
Key features include:

*   **Preconfigured templates:**
    OP-Deployer provides templates that encapsulate best practices, ensuring that your chain is configured according to standard specifications.

*   **Automated validations:**
    The tool performs checks during the deployment process to flag any deviations from standard configurations, such as unsupported modules or governance misalignments.

*   **Ease of customization within standards:**
    While ensuring compliance, OP-Deployer allows for minor, non-breaking customizations to suit specific use cases.

By using OP-Deployer, developers can reduce the complexity of chain deployment while ensuring alignment with Superchain standards.

  The Rollup configuration is an active work in progress and will likely evolve
  significantly as time goes on. If something isn't working about your
  configuration, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/optimism/blob/develop/op-chain-ops/genesis/config.go).

## Why standardization matters

Standardization benefits the Superchain ecosystem in several ways:

*   **Interoperability:**
    Enables seamless interactions between chains, such as cross-chain messaging and token transfers.

*   **Simplified Development:**
    Reduces the learning curve for developers by providing consistent and predictable configurations.

*   **Ecosystem Growth:**
    Encourages a thriving ecosystem by lowering barriers to entry and fostering collaboration.

*   **Reduced Support Overhead:**
    Minimizes the need for custom support by ensuring uniformity across deployments.

    **Native ETH as gas token:**
    All transactions on the network must use ETH for gas payments, maintaining consistency with Ethereum's native token model.

### Standard features

*   **Default system contracts:**
    Core protocol contracts must use unmodified implementations provided by the OP Stack to guarantee security and compatibility.

*   **Standard bridge implementations:**
    Cross-chain communication must use official bridge contracts to ensure secure and standardized asset transfers.

*   **Specified sequencer configurations:**
    Sequencer settings must follow prescribed parameters for transaction ordering and submission to maintain network stability.

## What is Not Standard?

Certain configurations are explicitly not part of the standard setup. For example:

*   **Custom Gas Tokens:**
    Introducing a gas token other than the default is currently not considered standard.

*   **Non-Conforming Modules:**
    Using modules not officially supported by the OP Stack.

*   **Modified system contracts:**
    Any alterations to core system contracts break standardization and aren't supported in the official OP Stack specification.

For a detailed list of standard configurations, refer to the [Standard rollup configuration page](/superchain/blockspace-charter).

## Superchain Registry

The [Superchain Registry](/superchain/superchain-registry) is the authoritative index of all chains within the Superchain ecosystem. It ensures:

*   **Transparency:**
    All registered chains are publicly listed with their configurations.

*   **Compliance verification:**
    Chains listed in the registry are verified for adherence to the standard configuration.

*   **Community trust:**
    Being part of the registry signals reliability and alignment with Superchain principles.

## Next Steps

1.  **Understand standards:**
    Familiarize yourself with the [OP Stack specifications](https://specs.optimism.io/protocol/configurability.html) and the Blockspace Charter.

2.  **Use OP-Deployer:**
    Leverage OP-Deployer to ensure your chain aligns with standard configurations.

3.  **Seek guidance:**
    Consult the [developer support](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/developers/discussions) team for clarifications on standardization.

4.  **Contribute to the ecosystem:**
    Engage with the Superchain community to share feedback and propose improvements.
